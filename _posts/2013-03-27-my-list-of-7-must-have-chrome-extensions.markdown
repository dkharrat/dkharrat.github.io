I sometimes get inquires from friends and colleagues of what extensions I use for Chrome. Rather than sending out links or explaining what they are, I thought of documenting my favorite list of Chrome Extensions that I can't work without:

1. [Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko): Manage your browser sessions
2. [Google Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja): Double-click on any word on the page to view its definition.
3. [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc): View pretty-formated JSON content
4. [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword): Save and generate passwords for a site
5. [Pocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj): Save current page to read later anywhere
6. [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm) â€“ REST Client: Nice tool to debug HTTP requests
7. [Appspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/homgcnaoacgigpkkljjjekpignblkeae): Detect web applications and javascript libraries run on browsing website.

Suggestions to other useful extensions are welcome!
