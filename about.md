I'm Dia Kharrat, a software engineer and entrepreneur, living in the Silicon Valley in California. I've worked at NVIDIA, Yahoo, and BrightRoll, and also co-founded Pixineers and DevMaster.net. Areas I've worked on include large-scale distributed systems, mobile platforms, and web applications. One fun fact about me: I started programming at the age of 9 using the LOGO programming language.
